    We believe what you eat and drink shouldn't just taste good, it should do
    good too. We source small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of
    the profits are reinvested in their communities.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
